# Handel

This is a web application dedicated to managing user information with JWT authentication developed with the MERN stack for the RIFSON music and language school in the city of Potosi, which is part of the Handel project presented at the Domingo Savio University for a degree in systems engineering.

Users can register and create analysis instances that can then contain musical information from an audio file.
